## About the Project


My project, *The Fuel Efficency and Weight of Cars*, utilizes the tidyverse and ggthemes packages to analyze data from the mtcars dataset, specifically looking at the relationship between the fuel efficency and weight of cars.

### Goals
- To analyze the mtcars dataset, specifically looking at the fuel efficiency and weight of cars   
  + had to make sure to load the libraries before analyzing the data, because otherwise an error would occur
- Model the relationship between these 2 variables
